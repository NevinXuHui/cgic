==~~爱~~==你==~~孤~~==身==~~走~~==暗==~~巷~~==

==~~爱~~==你==~~不~~==跪==~~的~~==模==~~样~~==

==~~爱~~==你==~~对~~==峙==~~过~~==绝==~~望~~==

==~~不~~==肯==~~哭~~==一==~~场~~==

==~~爱~~==你==~~破~~==烂==~~的~~==衣==~~裳~~==

==~~却~~==敢==~~堵~~==命==~~运~~==的==~~枪~~==

==~~爱~~==你==~~和~~==我==~~那~~==么==~~像~~==

==~~缺~~==口==~~都~~==一==~~样~~==

==~~去~~==吗 ==~~配~~==吗 ==~~这~~==褴==~~褛~~==的==~~披~~==风

==~~战~~==吗 ==~~战~~==啊 ==~~以~~==最==~~卑~~==微==~~的~~==梦

==~~致~~==那==~~黑~~==夜==~~中~~==的==~~呜~~==咽==~~与~~==怒==~~吼~~==

==~~谁~~==说==~~站~~==在==~~光~~==里==~~的~~==才==~~算~~==英==~~雄~~==
