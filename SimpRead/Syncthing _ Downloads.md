## Integrations

These are some popular and user friendly OS integrations, providing things like system tray icons, file browser integration, etc. These are good starting points if you are a new user unfamiliar with Syncthing, or not prone to loving the command line.

*   **[SyncTrayzor](https://github.com/canton7/SyncTrayzor/releases/latest)**: Windows tray utility, filesystem watcher & launcher
*   **[syncthing-macos](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-macos/releases/latest)**: macOS application bundle

There’s a wealth of further integrations of all kinds listed on the [community contributions](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/contrib.html) page. Each integration has their own issue tracker for integration-specific issues, but discussion and assistance for all of them is welcome on the [forum](https://forum.syncthing.net/).

## Android

The Android app is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid) and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/).

## Base Syncthing

This is the basic Syncthing distribution, providing a command line / daemon like executable and a web based user interface.

##### Syncthing **v1.23.6**

If you are unsure what to download and you’re running on a normal computer, please use the “64-bit (x86-64)” build for your operating system. If you’re running on an oddball system such as a NAS, please consult your vendor.

## Debian / Ubuntu Packages

Packages and installation instructions are available at [apt.syncthing.net](https://apt.syncthing.net/).
